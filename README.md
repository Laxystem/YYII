# Yes, Y is infinite.

Experimental mod allowing vertical chunks within Minecraft's overworld.

## Scope
It is a _non-goal_ to create additional content for the game.

It is a _non-goal_ to fix floating point inaccuracies in extreme y levels.

It is a _goal_ to make all minecraft worldgen _possible_ below y=-64 and above y=320,
however, it is a _non-goal_ to actually generate vanilla contents within those y levels.
